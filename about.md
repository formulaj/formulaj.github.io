## About 
Formula j is an amazing virtual racing game, created by Mia Wilkes :).

Drivers compete in teams to win chamionships - winner of the Teams' chamionship takes home a grand prize of 100 credits.
After the season, we now have the new Play Offs! Exclusive to the top 20 drivers in the championship. That winner takes home the prize of 25 credits.

## History of Formula j

In the first season of Formula j, Sophia was rocking the game, single handedly winning both the Drivers' and Teams' championship. After that incredible season, she decided to die, going 21 aggression, not scoring any points whatsoever - basically, don't go 21 aggression, folks!

In Season 2, with Sophia out of the way and taking Royal Deluxe down with her, the competiton was rife! Unexpectedly, gentle giant Vrish won his first season for Yer Da, with Yer Da winning the Teams' Championship with the help of his team leader Vedang. Not so impressive but ah well...

Season 3 was an odd one. Jemima, only winning two races, took the Drivers' Championship, whilst Your Mum took the Teams' Championship by hiring a very special guest driver: Season 1 winner, Sophia! Obviously, she won the race, starting several places ahead of their rivals. This has now been banned, not so unexpectedly. 
This was also the trial season of the Play Offs! Vrish won this. From here on, Play Offs were then continued for future seasons.

Season 4 was a comeback for Sophia, with her up-and-coming team: Daddy Issues! At this point, alliances had been made: Yer Da teamed up with Peaky Drivers; Your Mum, given the fantastic result in season 3, teamed up with Daddy Issues. These allegiances seemed to work phenomenally, with Sophia winning Driver's Championship, and Yer Da narrowly winning Teams'. Outstandingly, these four teams also took every win between them. Obviously, their contracts were renewed for oncoming seasons.
Play Offs were intense this season - the first one with a prize! Sophia, in a Yer Da car, won this, taking home 25 credits, shared with Yer Da.

Season 5 was bizarre. Dark horse Anushka came up from seemingly nowhere mid-season. At that point, Anushka seemed like the obvious favourite, with Vrish and Sophia with a small but not impossible gap in points. Going into the last four races, the doors were wide open. In a surprising turn of events, the favourites had a hard time scoring. Anushka wrapped up the Drivers' Championship and Your Mum, with the crucial help of Jemima in the last race, won the Teams' championship. 
All is open for Play Offs... Hopefully a thriling end to the season.
