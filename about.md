## About 
Formula j is an amazing virtual racing game, created by Mia Wilkes :).

Drivers compete in teams to win chamionships - winner of the Teams' chamionship takes home a grand prize of 100 credits.
After the season, we now have the new Play Offs! Exclusive to the top 20 drivers in the championship. That winner takes home the prize of 25 credits.

## History of Formula j

In the first season of Formula j, no-one knew what to expect. What A Lovely Day with consistent Sam-K looked like the initial favourites, quickly followed by brand new Royal Deluxe, lead by Jocelyn. After getting warmed up, Sophia was rocking the game. Single handedly, she won both the Drivers' and Teams' championship for Royal Deluxe. 
After that incredible season, she decided to die, going 21 aggression, not scoring any points whatsoever - basically, don't go 21 aggression, folks!

In Season 2, with Sophia out of the way and taking Royal Deluxe down with her, the competiton was rife! With What A Lovely Day also out of the competition, everything was up for grabs. Your Mum fought impressively, though, unexpectedly, gentle giant Vrish won his first season for Yer Da, with Yer Da winning the Teams' Championship with the help of team leader Vedang. Not so impressive but ah well... 

Season 3 was an odd one. You Mum and Yer Da were in fierce competition, taking every win, bar one, of the season. Jemima, took the Drivers' Championship, whilst Your Mum took the Teams' Championship by hiring a very special guest driver: Season 1 winner, Sophia! She won the race, starting several places ahead of their rivals - Yer Da, who were only 6 points behind with a fantastic chance to take it all away from You Mum! This has now been banned, not so unexpectedly. As a result, alliances had been born: Yer Da teamed up with 3rd place team Peaky Drivers; Your Mum, given the fantastic result in season 3, teamed up with Sophia's team, Daddy Issues.
This was also the trial season of the Play Offs! Vrish was pronounced winner. From here on, Play Offs were then continued for future seasons.

Season 4 was a comeback for Sophia, with her up-and-coming team: Daddy Issues! The new alliances seemed to work phenomenally: Sophia won Driver's Championship, and Yer Da narrowly won Teams', both for the second time. Outstandingly, these four teams also took every win between them and their contracts were renewed for oncoming seasons.
Play Offs were intense this season - the first one with a prize! Sophia won this for enemy team Yer Da. She took home 25 credits, shared with Yer Da.

Season 5 was bizarre. Old team What A Lovely Day were revived causing a disturbance in the favourite teams. Ultimately, with few entries, they were unable to do much damage. Dark horse Anushka came up from seemingly nowhere mid-season. At that point, Anushka seemed like the obvious favourite, with Vrish and Sophia with a small but not impossible gap in points. Going into the last four races, the doors were wide open. In a surprising turn of events, the favourites had a hard time scoring. Anushka wrapped up the Drivers' Championship and Your Mum, with the crucial help of Jemima in the last race, won the Teams' championship. Yer Da marginally missed out by only 4 points - a painful end to the season.
All is open for Play Offs... Hopefully a thriling end to the season.
