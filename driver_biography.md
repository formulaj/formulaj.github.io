## Vedang
Vedang started his Formula j career with a bang! After winning his first ever race in season 1, he turned into a bit of a disappointment. He soon took the record number of wins, which he still currently holds, and currently has made the most money for his team. Vedang, whilst he is an undoubtedly spectacular drvier, has not achieved his full potential: he has not been close to winning a championship until season 6, beaten by his previously uncompetitive teammate in season 2. He also owns undoubtedly the best team, Yer Da, winning a record of 3 Teams' Championships. Still, Vedang clearly remains the best driver, with a substantial lead in points and an incredible points per race. 

## Vrish
After an awful first season, Vrish had an amazing recovery. Winning season 2 by a comfortable margin, holding the lead number of points until season 6 and being one of the most consistent drivers. He also won the first ever Play Offs Championship in season 3, after finishing the season second with a similarly extraodinary performance tha he had in season 2. Vrish has not the best time after moving to Peaky Drivers: he has won very few races since, and has finished with a surprsingly low number of points. Coming second in total number of points and a similarly fantastic number of points per race, Vrish remains the second best driver. This season, he is moving to Yer Da again - will he recreate his incredible season 2? Or has his Formula j career come to a steep decline? 

## Sophia
Sophia had a dominant first season, winning 5 races in that season alone and every single championship available for Royal Deluxe - both records which have not been broken. From then, Sophia essentially threw a possibly dominant career after increasing her aggression to an unreasonably high 21. She scored no points in season 2, and very few points in season 3, mainly through cheating with Your Mum: upon lowering her aggression and turning into a contract driver from race 8, she was hired by Your Mum for the final race, starting several places ahead of any rival, to win them the Driver's Championship against Yer Da. Sophia has since teamed up with Your Mum to win season 4, her second Driver's Championship - another record that still remains. She won the second and third Play Offs, though not for her own teams. Sophia then had an appalling next two seasons, not winning a single race in season 6. With 2 championships and a record number of DNFs, she is the 3rd best driver in Formula j.

## Anushka
Anushka has always been a dark horse driver in Formula j. Excluding her championship win in season 5, Anushka has never achieved anything great throughout Formula j. Even in season 5, she scored the lowest number of points to take the championship win. Despite her disappointing driver results, she owns an impressive team (Your Mum) who have won 2 Teams' Championships. She has also competed in every single race in Formula j - the only driver to have done so - and has the second highest number of podiums. She has won 3 Qualifying Championships and the most recent Play Offs Championship. 

## Jemima
Jemima's had an unusual time in Formula j. After a disappointing first season, Jemima has done well throughout Formula j. She won season 3 with an incredibly consistent set of results and scoring an outstanding 178 points - the most anyone has scored in a season. She then went on to have an appalling season 4, scoring only 37 points. Driving for Your Mum, Jemima has proved herself to be a strong driver and a great team playing, helping her team become the second best in Formula j.

## Addison
The best driver to have not entered all seasons and not won a championship, Addison has improved exponentially over his career. Starting at Peaky Drivers, Addison proved himself a promising driver. After finishing 5th in season 3, Addison proved himself enough to forge an alliance with Yer Da. Since then, Addison has consistently done exceptionally, with two 3rd places and a second in season 6. His promising set of results assures us that we will see great things - maybe even a driver championship in the not-too-distant future? 

## Mia
One of the most consistent drivers in Formula j, Mia has made Pentachoron a fiercely competitive team to rival the two big corporations. With the highest percent finishes in top 10, Mia is definitely one to watch in the future. This season, she won her first ever race and scored the most points in her career so far.
